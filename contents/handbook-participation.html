<p>To get the full 10 marks allocated for participation you should satisfy the following criteria, evaluated based on
  peer evaluations and tutor observations. We will also take into account data recorded in other systems e.g. GitHub,
  IVLE.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistent Effort</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Finished at least 7 post-lecture quizzes. You must get all answers correct for a quiz to count for
        participation. As you know, the quiz allows unlimited attempts and we count the best attempt only.
      </li>
      <li>Earned at least 7 individual effort points. A student who has done at least one learning activity for the week
        will earn an individual effort point for that week. Max available individual effort points per student: 12
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Timeliness</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Not frequently late for meetings/tutorials.</li>
      <li>Arriving more than 5 minutes late for a tutorial is considered late.</li>
      <li>Almost always delivers/submits on time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Teamwork</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>At least 7 team effort points. A team who has completed all basic and intermediate learning activities
        collectively earns 1 team effort point. Max available team effort points per student: 11
      </li>
      <li>Helps team members when possible and engages team members’ help when needed. This also means the student
        attends weekly meetings and works with others to complete the learning activities.
      </li>
      <li>Communicates sufficiently and professionally. Does not use offensive language in project communications.</li>
      <li>Responds to communication from team members in a timely manner (e.g. within 24 hours).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Reliability</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Promises what he/she will contribute in advance, and delivers what’s promised.</li>
      <li>Does not deliver work products that seem to be below the student's competence level i.e. tries his/her best to
        make the work product as high quality as possible within his/her competency level.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Meticulousness</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Rarely overlooks a submission requirements.</li>
      <li>Have not missed compulsory module activities such as completing the Welcome Survey and the TEAMMATES profile.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The scheme tries to,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make the participation effort independent of the competency level. I.e. If you have the right attitude and put in
    enough effort, you should be able to get full marks for participation.
  </li>
  <li>Not demand perfection. You should be able to earn full marks even if you falter occasionally.</li>
</ul>
