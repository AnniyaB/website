                Do one of the following (try to ensure at least one member does each):
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Relate</strong> (no need to draw) at least 2 “non-examinable” UML models to your project.<br>Explain why/where the model is potentially applicable or why it is not applicable to the project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Draw</strong> an activity diagram to represent a workflow/algorithm in your part of the project.<br>If your part of the project does not have any workflows, you can draw an activity diagram to represent the workflow of a user using your team’s product.<br>Bring the diagram to the tutorial.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Draw</strong> an OODM for your project. Remember, OODM is about the problem domain, not about the solution.<br> Classes such as GUI, Manager, Storage should not appear in the OODM but it can have classes such as Task and Reminder.<br>It should be about how a person deals with his/her schedules and tasks. Bring the diagram to the tutorial.
