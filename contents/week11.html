            <div>
                Do one of the following (try to ensure at least one member does each):
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Relate</strong> (no need to draw) at least 2 “non-examinable” UML
                        models to your project. Explain why/where the model is potentially applicable
                        or why it is not applicable to the project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Draw</strong> an activity diagram to represent a workflow/algorithm
                        in your part of the project. If your part of the project does not have any
                        workflows, you can draw an activity diagram to represent the workflow of a
                        user using your team’s product.<br>Bring the diagram to the tutorial.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Draw</strong> an OODM for your project. Remember, OODM is about the
                        problem domain, not about the solution. Classes such as GUI, Manager,
                        Storage should not appear in the OODM but it can have classes such as Task
                        and Reminder.<br>It should be about how a person deals with his/her schedules
                        and tasks. Bring the diagram to the tutorial.
