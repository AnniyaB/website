<p>We have a separate website because some  the module information does not fit into the structure 
imposed by IVLE.</p>
<p>On a related note, keep in mind that &lsquo;hunting and gathering&rsquo; of relevant 
information is one of the skills you need to survive &lsquo;in the wild&rsquo;. Do not always 
expect all relevant materials to appear &lsquo;magically&rsquo; in some kind of &lsquo;work bin
&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Furthermore, unlike IVLE, a copy of the module website <span class="highlighted">will remain 
online</span> at<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1516S1/">
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1516S1/</a> for your reference for the next few years.</p>
