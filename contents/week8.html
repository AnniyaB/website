        Work as a team to complete V0.0 that you started last week.
        Transfer the content to the relevant pages in your main repo.
        <ul>
          <li><span class="highlighted">MUST DO</span> : Complete the <code>UserGuide.md</code> page.
            This page should tell us in detail what is the product you plan to deliver at the end of the semester.
            We are going to use it to give feedback about your product design over the next week.
          </li>
          <li>Update the <code>AboutUs.md</code> page. In particular, indicate which member is in charge of
          which component (i.e. UI, Logic, Storage, etc.).<br>
            <span class="dim">Note: Being 'in charge' of a component does not mean you work in that component only.
            Rather, you are expected to know it well and possibly review/approve
            changes done to that component by others.</span></li>
          <li>Update the <code>README.md</code> page to match your project. In particular, add a UI prototype of
          your intended final product</li>
          <li>Complete these appendices of the <code>DeveloperGuide.md</code> within the next two weeks.</li>
        </ul>
        Submission:<br>
        Create a PR from your team repo <code>master</code> branch to
        <code>https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1617S1/addressbook-level4</code>.
        Name it <code>[T7][Your-Team-ID]</code> e.g. <code>[T7][W09-C3]</code>

      <h3>T7A3. Reach V0.1<img src="../images/star.png"/></h3>
      <div>
        Work as a team to deliver V0.1. Note the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Aim to deliver at least add/delete/find support for floating tasks. You should be able to do this
            by deleting/renaming the given Address Book code, without having to add too much new code.
          </li>
          <li><span class="highlighted">Please watch the webcast if you missed Lecture 7</span>.
            We noticed that in the previous week many teams wasted time designing an unrealistic UI for their product
            because they did not pay attention to the sample UI shown to them in Lecture 6. Lecture 7 too
            contained some information important for V0.1.</li>
          <li>
            Change code in small steps, run tests after each step, commit each step, and merge often.
          </li>
          <li>Following things can be dropped if you find them too much trouble.
            They are not compulsory to have in the final version.
            <ul>
              <li>Automated GUI testing</li>
              <li>Using Gradle to build the project</li>
              <li>Using Travis for CI</li>
              <li>Using regular expressions for parsing: feel free to switch to a simpler technique.</li>
              <li>Using new Java 8 lambdas and streams : feel free to use normal <code>for</code> loops instead.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>If you feel Level 4 code is too daunting</strong> for you to use as the starting point,
            you may use Level 3 code as your starting point instead.</li>
        </ul>
        Submission:<br>
        No separate submission required as your T7A3 work will be captured in the T7A2 submission above.

            Singleton is a neat pattern and it is easy to explain too. That is why it is used often to
            illustrate  the concept of design patterns. However, there is a concern that Singletons are evil,
            especially when used excessively.
