    <span class="keyword"><b>[ You . Together . Continuously . Reach ]</b></span>
</p>
<p>
    These are some of the main principles underlying the module structure.
</p>
<p>
    <b>The product is <span class="keyword">you</span>, NOT what you build.</b>
</p>
<p>
    The software product you build is a side effect only. <i>You</i> are the product of this module. This means,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We may not take the most efficient route to building the software product. We take the route that allows you to learn the most.
    </li>
    <li>
        Building a software product that is unique, creative, and shiny is not our priority (although we try to do a bit of that too). Learning to take pride in, and discovering the joy of, high quality software engineering work is our priority.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Following from that, we evaluate you on not just much you've done, but also, how well you've done those things.
</p>
<p>
    Here are some of the aspects in which we try to make you more professional:

            But we value more ...

    <b>We learn <span class="keyword">together</span>, NOT compete against each other.</b>
</p>
<p>
    You are not in a competition. Our grading is not forced on a bell curve.
</p>
<p>
    Learn from each other. That is why we publish submissions.
</p>
<p>
    Teach each other, even those in other teams. Those who do it well can become tutors next time.
</p>
<p>
    <b><span class="keyword">Continuously</span> engage, NOT last minute heroics.</b>
</p>
<p>
    We want to train you to do software engineering in a steady and repeatable manner that does not require 'last minute heroics'.
</p>
<p>
    In this module, last minute heroics will not earn you a good project grade, and last minute mugging will not earn you a good exam grade.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Where you <span class="keyword">reach</span> at the end matters, NOT what you knew at the beginning.</b>
</p>
<p>
    When you start the module, some others in the class may appear to know a lot more than you. Don't let that worry you. The final grade depends on what you know at the end, not what you knew to begin with. The full 10% allocated to intermediate deliverables is within the reach of everyone in the class irrespective of their prior knowledge.
