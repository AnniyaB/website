<h3>V0.4 Product</h3>
<p>Functionality expectations: This version should have decent implementations fo all major features you intend to
  release, although some finer
  tweaks may be missing and not completely stable.</p>
<p>
  <strong> Mark your code</strong> with special tag @@author so that we can extract code written by each of
  you using the collate tool (for evaluation purposes). After that, Use the collate tool to extract individual code and
  look through the generated <strong> .md</strong> files to ensure all your code has been extracted correctly. <span
    class="highlighted">Push the *.md files created to a folder called /collated</span> in your repo. More instructions
  below. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Extract your code for code quality grading </strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Download the <a href="https://github.com/collate/collate" target="_blank">collate tool</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mark your code with a <code>//@@author matric-number</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>. The comment syntax
    may vary based on file type e.g. for html
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="lang-html"><<!--\-->!-- @@author matric-number --></code></pre>
  </li>
  <p>
    Here is a sample code file:
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint"><code>//@@author A0909865T
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author A0702345U
method 3 ...
//@@author A0909865X
method 4 ...</code></pre>
  <li>
    The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code a person wrote. The code up to the
    next <code>//@@author</code> tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written
    by that author.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a method was written by more than one person, the <code>//@@author</code> tag should indicate the person who
    wrote most of that method. i.e., <code>//@@author</code> tag should not appear inside a method.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you wrote a significant amount of code that was not used in the final product, you may use <code>//@@author
    matric-number-unused</code> to mark them.
  </li>
  e.g.
  <pre class="prettyprint"><code>//@@author A0909865T-unused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...</code></pre>
  Please put a comment in the code to explain why it was not used.
  <br>
  <li>
    The <code>//@@author</code> tag should be used to mark *all* code you claim credit for.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong> INCLUDE</strong>: everything that required significant ‘writing’ effort. e.g. comments,
      test code, documentation, styling (e.g. css), xml, even test data files. But do not include chunks of text
      that were trivially copy pasted e.g. a test data file with 1000 tasks that was used to test performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong> Code you reused </strong>from elsewhere: Mark such code as <code>//@@author matric-number-reused</code>
    </li>
    e.g.
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code>//@@author A0909865T-reused
method 1 ...
method 2 ...</code></pre>
    where the matric number belongs to the person responsible for reusing that code.
    <li>
      <strong> EXCLUDE</strong> code generated by the IDE/framework. You may also mark such code
      <code>//@@author generated</code></li>
    e.g.
    <pre class="prettyprint"><code>//@@author generated
method 1 ...
method 2 ...</code></pre>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Submission</strong>: Push the code to GitHub and tag as <span class="code">V0.4</span>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Grading</strong>: To pass this checkpoint, your product should satisfy the description given above and the
  code should be collated properly.
</p>
<h3>V0.4 Documentation</h3>
<div id="handbook-project-v04-documentation"></div>
<p>
  Your project documentation should contain following pages/sections:
</p>
<p>
  Recommended to update the documentation to match the product, at least w.r.t. major changes since previous version.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Submission</strong>: Must be included in the version tagged <span class="code">V0.4</span>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Grading</strong>: Not graded.<br>
</p>

<h3>V0.4 Demo</h3>
<div id="handbook-project-v04-demo"></div>
<p>
  <strong>Submission</strong>: Demo to the tutor during the tutorial. <strong>Use jar</strong> file for the demo, not
  using the IDE.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Grading</strong>: Must use the jar file from the version tagged <span class="code">V0.4</span> and prove
  that product meets the functionality expectations.
