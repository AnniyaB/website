'content goes here' 
<p>
I encountered a problem. How do I get help? Whether it is a technical problem (e.g. error when using Eclipse) or a doubt about a concept (e.g. what is the difference between scripted testing and exploratory testing?) the teaching team is happy to work with you when you look for a solution/answer. But we do not do it for you. Do not fire off an ‘SOS’ email to the lecturer/tutor right away. Instead, this is what you should do. We discourage unconditional direct help because we want you to learn to help yourself. Yes, we believe in ‘tough love’.

However, we don’t want you to suffer without any help if you cannot solve a problem on your own. We have weekly wrap up session (Wed-Fri) on TEAMMATES which you can use to let us know the doubts and difficulties you are facing. We’ll do our best to direct you toward solutions. Please use those sessions <span class="highlighted">only if you facing difficulties even after attending the corresponding tutorial session</span>.
