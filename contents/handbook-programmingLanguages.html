		Our learning materials (lecture slides, tutorials, etc.) use Java code examples. But <span class="highlighted">you may use Java or C++ in your tutorial/exam answers, and for the project.</span>

		The module doesn’t “teach” any of these two languages. We assume you already know these languages. We expect you to learn on your own any language constructs not covered in your previous modules.

<p>Handouts provide C++ translations for some Java examples. If you are a C++ user and if feel a certain Java example is not clear to you and there is no C++ translation provided for it, please let us know so that we can add the C++ translation for it.</p>
