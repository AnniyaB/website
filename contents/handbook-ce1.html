        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Write a CLI (Command Line Interface) program called TextBuddy using Java/C++ to manipulate text in a file. Here is a sample interaction with the program. Text in purple are commands entered by the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                c:&gt; TextBuddy.exe mytextfile.txt  (OR c:&gt;java  TextBuddy mytextfile.txt)<br>
                Welcome to TextBuddy. mytextfile.txt is ready for use<br>
                command: add little brown fox<br>
                added to mytextfile.txt: "little brown fox"<br>
                command: display<br>
                1. little brown fox<br>
                command: add jumped over the moon<br>
                added to mytextfile.txt: "jumped over the moon"<br>
                command: display<br>
                1. little brown fox<br>
                2. jumped over the moon<br>
                command: delete 2<br>
                deleted from mytextfile.txt: "jumped over the moon"<br>
                command: display<br>
                1. little brown fox<br>
                command: clear<br>
                all content deleted from mytextfile.txt<br>
                command: display<br>
                mytextfile.txt is empty<br>
                command: exit<br>
                c:&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that mytextfile.txt is a parameter given when running the program. i.e., The name of the file is not always mytextfile.txt. [C++ guys: Here's an article on how to handle command line parameters]
            </p>
            <p>
                You may make any reasonable assumptions about program behavior not evident from the above sample. State all your assumptions in the header comment of the TextBuddy main file.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things to look out for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The file can be saved to the disk (a) after each user operation, (b) periodically e.g., every 5 seconds, (c) when the user exit the program. We are interested to know which option you choose. Hint: Avoid pre-mature optimizations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are VERY interested in how human-understandable your code is, and how well it follows the specified coding standard (Java coding standard, C++ coding standard).

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                <b>IMPORTANT: Please follow submission instructions precisely e.g. file format, file name, page header, cover page content etc. Your submissions are processed -- sometimes by automated scripts, sometimes manually -- and those processes break if the submission is not in the expected format. On a related note, we are in a field where small details matter. Train yourself to pay attention to details. We cannot afford to be sloppy.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                You need to submit your work in BOTH these formats.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Source format (for accuracy checking)
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Put testinput.txt, expected.txt files used for testing in the same folder where TextBuddy.class or TextBuddy.exe is.<br>
                        C++ users: to reduce file size, you can remove those big *.ipch files created by Visual Studio.<br>
                        Note: testinput.txt and expected.txt are the files you used for regression testing of your program, using the technique explained in the Lecture 1 handout about regression testing. For example,<br>
                        TextBuddy.exe mytestfile.txt &lt;testinput.txt &gt;output.txt<br>
                        FC output.txt expected.txt
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Zip up the entire project folder in zip format (no other archiving formats please). It should also include source files (.java, .h, .cpp etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Name it "["Tutorial group ID"]["Your full name"][CE1][java | cpp]".zip (e.g. [w10][Li Jien][CE1][java].zip) Use the exact tutorial group ID as specified in our Schedule page (See under Tutorial Schedule section)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Upload to the appropriate IVLE folder.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Document format (for code quality checking and giving feedback)
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Copy paste ALL your code, input.txt, and expected.txt to a single document (use this template) and save in pdf format.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Name it similar to the zip file (e.g. [w10][Li Jien][CE1][cpp].pdf)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Submit it to the appropriate IVLE folder.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Notes:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If re-uploading an updated version, please delete the previous version first. IVLE does not overwrite the previous version.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All submissions will be published to the class.
