<p>
	<strong> The structure of our tutorials</strong> is different from traditional tutorials.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> 50% assessment/feedback</strong>: Up to 50% of our tutorial time is to be spent on interacting with
		your tutor as directed by the tutor. The purpose of this interaction is for the tutor to assess
        learning activities you claim to have done and give you feedback.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> 50% discussion</strong>: The remaining 50% of the tutorial time is to be spent
		on discussing module activities with team members and helping each other w.r.t. those activities.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>The role of our tutors</strong> is different from tutors in other modules.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> No direct tech help</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from giving technical help, because we want
		you to learn the vital survival skill of troubleshooting technical problems.
        <div class="dim">[cf Appendix D: <a href="#handbook-appendixD">How to get tech help</a>]</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> No ‘teaching’</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from “teaching” concepts that are covered in
		lectures or handouts. Self-learning is a vital part of the module. But tutors may help you clarify doubts.
		For example consider these two questions you might want to ask a tutor:
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>This is how I understood/applied dependency injection. Is that correct?</em> - Such questions are welcome.
		</li>
		<strong>Reason</strong>:This question shows you have put in some effort to learn the topic and seeking
		further clarification from the tutor.
		<br>
		<li>
			<em>What is dependency injection?</em> - Such questions are not allowed.
		</li>
		<strong>Reason</strong>: This question implies you haven’t done what you could to learn the topic in
		concern.
		<br>
	</ul>
	<li>
		<strong>No leading from the front</strong>: Tutors are not expected to lead your project effort.
		They will not tell you how to do project tasks or when to do project tasks.
        You have to figure those out yourselves. But tutors will give
		you feedback on how you are doing (or have done) project tasks so that you can improve further.

	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Timing/venue</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Please refer to the Schedule page for further details on each tutorial.
	</li>
	<li>
		You are expected to arrive on time.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If your tutorial is in <strong>COM1-B103</strong>: If you arrive early, you may enter the tutorial
			room by the door near the
			staircase and wait in the empty area of the room until the current class vacates the room.
		</li>
		<li>
			If your tutorial is in <strong>SR5</strong>: If you arrive early, please wait outside the room until
			you are asked to come in.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>
		You may leave the class 15 minutes before the hour if you have another class right after. There is no need to
		wait till the tutor dismisses you.
        However, inform the tutor before leaving if you leave before the class is dismissed.
	</li>
	<li>
		Please make sure you vacate the table 5 minutes before the hour so that the next group can start on time. You
		may move to the empty area at the back of the room and continue your discussions after the class is over.
	</li>
	<li>
		In the past many students have suggested to increase the tutorial duration because 1 hour is barely enough
		to get through all the tutorial tasks. Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and
		tutors. What you can do is to extend the tutorial time by yourselves. e.g. Meet 30 minutes before the
		tutorial starts and prepare yourselves for the tutorial task. Similarly, you can move your discussion to
		somewhere else after the tutorial is over and continue for some more time.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Participation points</strong>: Tutorials can earn you participation points, calculated as
	follows.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Punctuality and attention</strong> [1 points]: Arrived on time [0.5] + stayed in the tutorial at least
		40 minutes and
		paid undivided attention to tutorial proceedings (i.e. no multi tasking) [0.5].
	</li>
	You get only 0.1 if arrived later than 30 minutes.
	<br>
	<li>
		<strong>pre-tutorial and during-tutorial learning tasks</strong>
		[Refer the “Schedule” page to find how much each task is
		worth].
	</li>
	For each pre-tutorial task, you get the stated number of points if you did the task before coming to the
	tutorial and came ready to demo the achievement right away. You can still get half the points if you didn’t do
	the pre-tutorial task before the tutorial but still managed to finish it before the end of the tutorial,
	possibly with the help of others.
	<br>
	<li>
		If you did not attend the tutorial:
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Pre-tutorial team learning activities: You still earn participation points.
		</li>
		<li>
			Pre-tutorial individual learning activities: You can earn participation points by emailing your tutor
			the results/proof of your individual tasks no later than the tutorial day.
		</li>
		<li>
			In-tutorial learning activities: No points for absentees.
		</li>
	</ul>

	</p>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Expectations</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Please bring your laptop to tutorials</strong>. You often need it to show your learning
		activity results. At other
		times, we ask you to work on project related things with your team members, which too may require
		the laptop.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Pay attention to discussions</strong>: When the tutor is discussing something with one team member
		(e.g., one team
		member is explaining how he/she used assertions), <strong>the whole team is expected to pay attention</strong>
		to that
		discussion, not do your own things. Whatever discussed is relevant to all of you, not just that team member.
