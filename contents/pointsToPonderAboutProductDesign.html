    <span>Here are some things to think about when refining the design of the product.</span></p>
    <h1><a name="General"></a>
    <span>General</span></h1>
    <ul><li ><p class="word-limit" >Make common things easy. What are the most common things a user may want to achieve using 
	the app? e.g. To find out the schedule for today/tomorrow. Make those things VERY easy to do.</p></li></ul>
     <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Make rare things possible: Think twice before prohibiting things such as overlapping events, 
	 editing past events, etc. For example, people do schedule things in the same period when they are not sure which one 
	 they are going to do. Not allowing it can be a great inconvenience. Highlighting and warning about overlaps is a better
	 approach.<br>That is not to say anything should be allowed. Disallowing certain things can even be beneficial to users. 
	 However, a decision to disallow a certain usage should be taken after careful consideration, not simply because it makes 
	 the implementation easier.<br>Similarly, the software must cater for the possibility of task description containing keywords
	 such as ‘from’ ‘to’. e.g., If the user wants to add the task ‘watch day after tomorrow’; 
	 (i.e., watch the movie named ‘day after tomorrow’) to the list, there should be a way to enter it without the 
	 software interpreting ‘tomorrow’ as the day for the task.</p></li></ul>
     <ul><li ><p class="word-limit" >Stick to users’ language: Using the names mentioned in the requirements (e.g. floating 
	 tasks) in the user guide or in the app itself might not make sense to users. If you want to stick with such terms, at least 
	 you should explain the terms to users. Do not make users learn new terms unless absolutely necessary.</p></li></ul>
     <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Use sensible defaults: Schedule the task NOW if no time is specified? really? Choose smart 
	 defaults when you can, but don’t chose silly defaults.</p></li></ul>
     <ul><li ><p class="word-limit" >Give only useful features: Reconsider features such as login, sort, hashtag, priority. 
	 They are OK to have if you have a strong justification. Always ask yourself, ‘What if we don’t have this feature? 
	 Is it going to be a problem for Jim?’. A feature common to other similar software may turn out to be useless for Jim.
	 <br>Similarly a feature that may be valuable to ‘somebody’ may not be valuable to Jim. For example, Jim uses the 
	 software from his office computer. A audio playback of the command is unlikely to be useful in such an environment. Imagine 
	 how Jim’s co-workers would feel if Jim’s computer keeps making audio commentary! </p></li></ul>
     <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Avoid half-baked features: When you implement a feature, consider all aspects of it. For example,
	 if your extra feature is GCal sync, consider things such as how to store floating tasks in GCal, how to sync older items in GCal 
	 with your software, how to sync repeating events, and so on. It is not necessary that you implement all those things. However, you
	 should have considered all those things and you should have good reasons why you chose what you implemented over what you did not 
	 implement. “Oh, we didn’t think of that” is not a good answer. </p> </li></ul>

    <h1><a name="Command"></a>Command format</h1>
    <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Optimize command format for users, not developers: Don’t design the command format solely to 
	make parsing easier. Primarily, it should be easy to remember and type. Ease of parsing is secondary.</p></li></ul><p ></p>
    <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Unix-like commands: Excessive use of symbols make the command hard to remember/type. We are 
	targeting fast typists, not necessarily UNIX system admins. No matter how fast you can type, normal letters are faster to 
	type than certain symbols such as -@#$^. But symbols such as . , / may be easier than other symbols.</p></li></ul><p ></p>
    <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Prefer typing over keyboard shortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts are useful and they do not require
	the mouse. But keep in mind that Jim prefers typing, not necessarily keyboard shortcuts. Keyboard shortcuts involving key 
	combinations often takes more time than regular typing.<br>Automatically generating a command template to fill in may not be
	good either. For a fast typist, editing an existing text by moving around using arrow/tab keys is slower than typing 
	everything in one burst. <br>The goal is to give Jim a faster ‘typing’ alternative to anything that can be done
	in other ways. </p></li></ul><p ></p>
    <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Avoil multi-step CLIs: The user should be able to accomplish most tasks using a single command.
	For example, the approach ‘type add, press enter, then type description, press enter again etc. is unacceptable. 
	</p></li></ul><p ></p>
    <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Flexible or rigid? The more you make the command “natural-language-like”, the higher 
	the risk of misinterpreting a user command. The more you use special symbols and strict formats, the harder it is for users to 
	use the software. How do you choose? May be you don’t have to choose. Why not support both? A flexible and natural format 
	that users will use most of the time, and a more rigid one when they have to issue a command that has a risk of misinterpretation.
	</p></li></ul>

    <h1><a name="UI"></a>UI</h1>
    <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Optimize the display format:</p></li>
    <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >For example, listing of tasks should be nicely laid out, sorted in a meaningful way,
	aligned properly, etc so that the user can read the information quickly. For example, the text UIs below have similar 
	content but one is much more readable than the other.</p>
      <span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: 
	  rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 562.67px; height: 405.33px;">

	  margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="">
	  </span><br></li>
      <li><p class="word-limit" >Consider how the display area will look like for scenarios such as when you have many tasks in a 
	  single day, when you have 100s of tasks in the system, when a task has a long description, etc. Will the display are look neat
	  and readable in those situations too?</p></li><li><p class="word-limit" >What format should you use to display date/times so
	  that it takes less space but still easy to understand? Is there any point in displaying year, seconds? Is it better to display
	  the day as well (e.g. Saturday)?</p></li><li><p class="word-limit" >But do be careful about going for a Calendar-like UIs 
	  (i.e., grids). They are a lot of work to implement and hard to get right. It may be easier to link up with existing calendar
	  interfaces such as Google Calendar.</p></li></ul><p></p>
    </ul>
    <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Give enough feedback to the user: When the user executes a command, the feedback given should
	be informative. e.g. When giving  feedback after adding a task, ‘Success’ is not good enough. Jim should see the
	details of the task added so that he can verify if it is indeed the task that he meant to add. <br>It may be even more useful
	if the result is shown ‘in context’. e.g. showing the newly added task together with the tasks in that day, but 
	the new one is highlighted</p></li></ul><p ></p><ul><li>Make use of the welcome screen: The welcome screen (what you display 
	at the very beginning) can be used to display something that is useful to the user, such as the tasks for the day.</p></li></ul><p ></p>
    <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Scrolling is a design fail: Yes, the use should be able to scroll when there is more information 
	to show than the display area allows. It is better if the user rarely need to scroll. You should design such that whatever 
	the user was looking for is already visible in the display area, without having to scroll. </p></li></ul>

    <h1><a name="Search"></a>Search</h1>
    <ul><li><p class="word-limit" >Give sensible search filters: <br>When searching for a task, what can we expect the user to type?
	Surely, we cannot expect them to type the original tasks name precisely?<br>When designing search options, start with the kind
	of things users may want to search for. For example, if Jim is trying to schedule a lunch appointment, he may want to search 
	for tasks (or free times) he has during lunch hour for the next few days, but he is unlikely to want to search for tasks 
	scheduled during a particular time in a particular day. Instead, he can simply display that day’s schedule to find that
	information.</p></li></ul>

    <h1><a name="Other"></a>Other</h1>
    <ul><li class="word-limit" >Saving things only at exit command is a bad idea; Data will be lost if the the program is 
	closed without using the exit command.</li>
      <li class="word-limit" >Is there any situation where a regular user may want to see a list *all* tasks? To sort all 
	  tasks alphabetically?</li>
      <li class="word-limit" >Are there other types of tasks that we should consider, in addition to the three types mentioned?</li>
      <li class="word-limit" >Should we force the user to explicitly identify task types or can the task type be dealt 
	  with internally most of the time?</li>
      <li class="word-limit" >What about conversions from one task type to another?</li>
      <li class="word-limit" >Is it better to show deadlines and timed tasks together or separately? Do people process 
	  those two types of things separately when they think about things they have to do?</li>
      <li class="word-limit" >What is the best way to handle overdue tasks? Automatically hide or highlight?</li>
      <li class="word-limit" >Is there a need to ask for confirmation when an undo feature is available?</li>
      <li class="word-limit" >How useful is automatic scheduling? Would you follow a schedule automatically generated by an app?  </li>
    </ul>
