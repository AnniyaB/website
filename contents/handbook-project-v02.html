This is the first MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the product.
<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="highlighted">It should be a viable, possibly minimal product</span>.
    This is not a walking skeleton. A user should be able to use
    it. It may not be user-friendly, but is should not be unusable. Try to include at least the basic CRUD
    facilities for at least one type of tasks. Here are some examples that are NOT acceptable:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      example 1. Has a well-developed functionality to add tasks but does not support commands for deleting or
      editing tasks: This is not usable because the user cannot rectify errors made while creating tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
      example 2. Has all the CRUD functionality implemented but they are not connected to the UI: This too is not
      usable by the end-user.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    This is <span class="highlighted">an internal release, not a production release.</span>
    While you are expected to maintain a reasonable code
    quality at all times, we do not require V0.1 to be ‘polished’ in UI, design, code, or testing. It is more of a
    ‘proof of concept’ prototype. The design is not required to be pure OO. Make a reasonable attempt to make it
    OO. Further refinement to the design can be done in V0.2 onwards.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="highlighted">Use V0.1 to validate your architecture.</span> This means you should
    try to include all major components of your
    architecture in V0.1, even if they are not fully implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="highlighted">Use V0.1 to try out ‘high risk, high value’ features.</span>
    In particular, the feature that is expected to make
    your product ‘stand out’ from the rest should be tried out as early as possible.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>V0.2 Documentation</h3>
<p>
  For milestones V0.2-V0.4, you are encouraged to update your project manual regularly to match the
  product. However, you are not required to submit them for evaluation, unless your tutor specifically
  requests you to. Note that this flexibility is just to reduce your workload. In a production environment,
  the documentation should always be kept in sync with the product.

<h3>V0.2 Demo</h3>
<p>
  The main objective of this session is <span class="highlighted">for the lecturer</span> to give
  feedback on your progress and future directions. V0.2 demos of all teams will be attended by the
  lecturer. Refer the Schedule page for more information about the demo.
</p>

<p>
  It’s immaterial how much the product is improved between versions, as long as it improves. If you are
  stressed about the workload, you may chose to do less for some intermediate versions. However, we expect
  you to spread out your work over the semester reasonably consistently. For example, doing very little in
  V0.1-V0.4 and doing a whole lot in V0.5 is liable for a penalty.
