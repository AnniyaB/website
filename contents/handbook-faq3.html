<p>
    We have a separate website because some the module information does not fit into the structure imposed by IVLE.
</p>
<p>
    On a related note, keep in mind that 'hunting and gathering' of relevant information is one of the skills you need to survive 'in the wild'. Do not always expect all relevant materials to appear 'magically' in some kind of 'work bin'.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, unlike IVLE, a copy of the module website <span class="highlighted">will remain online</span> at http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs2103/AY1415S2/ for your reference for the next few years.
