    <b>Where is everything?</b> CS2103/T-related information are mainly in one of these two places:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>The Schedule page</b> (organized chronologically): <span class="highlighted">That is the one page you need to refer weekly</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Module handbook</b> (i.e. this page. organized by topic) This is a reference document supplementary to the schedule page. This page contains a lot of text, probably too much to read in one sitting. Instead, <span class="highlighted">skim through it quickly to learn what it contains</span>. You can come back to read details as-and-when you need those details. The schedule page lists relevant sections of the Handbook you should read at various points.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>No reminder emails</b>: To follow the DRY principle, we try to minimize sending module details via announcements. Unlike the copy of the information in the website, the copy of the information sent out as emails cannot be updated, potentially resulting in inconsistencies of information. We have another reason for not sending frequent module announcements, which you will hear about in lecture 1.
</p>
<p>
    <b>CS2103 Vs CS2103T</b>: Same lectures, same exam. Separate tutorials, separate project grading. If not specifically mentioned, whatever is stated for one module applies to the other.
</p>
<p>
    <b>What did seniors say about this module?</b> CS2103/T is <b>practical</b> and <b>useful</b> module, but also a <b>heavy</b> and <b>intensive</b> module, as you can see from student feedback for a recent offering of the module.
