      <h3>Reach V0.2</h3>
      <div>
        This should be a working version that is better than the previous version in some way. 
        If required, update the project manual. For these intermediate milestones, the amount 
        of improvements between versions is not important. What matters is you moved the 
        product forward and everyone played a role in doing so. If your team is busy with 
        other modules, you can chose to do less (but you should do some), improvements. 
        But doing very little up to V0.4 and doing a lot in V0.5 is not acceptable.<br>

        Remember to <span class="highlighted-darktext">

        your V0.1 and V0.2 in the repo.</span>
        There should not be any pushing/pulling during the tutorial. You are expected to 
        have a stable V0.2 version in the repo before you come in. This V0.2 may or may not 
        be the latest code in the repo.

      <h3>[Individual, 5pts] Some systematic unit testing</h3>
      <div>
        (a) Ensure at least some automated tests exist for your part of the code.<br>
        Note: If you are doing the GUI component, you might find it harder to do unit 
        testing in there. In that case, you can get some more work assigned to you 
        (e.g., writing a utility class) from somewhere else for which you can write unit tests. 
        The important thing is to show us that you can write unit unit tests. Locating a place 
        to do that is up to you.<br>
        <br>
        (b) Insert at least some comments in the code to explain the relation between your 
        test cases and the test case design heuristics covered in the lecture.<br>
        e.g., /* This is a <strong>boundary case</strong> for the ‘negative value’ <strong>partition</strong> */<br>
        Note: For some SUTs, it is not easy to identify partitions and boundaries. Try harder. 
        If still cannot, look elsewhere. The important thing is to show us that you can apply 
        test case design heuristics in practice. Locating a good example to do that is up to you.
