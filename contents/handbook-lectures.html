        <b>More about in-lecture quizzes</b><br>
        We use the QuestionSMS system for in-lecture quizzes. Questions will be shown during the lecture. You can answer using SMS or the web interface http://qsms.nus.edu.sg/post.aspx.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>What if (I forgot to bring my phone | my phone battery died | I don't have a phone)?</b><br>
            Well, you don't get participation points if you didn't send the answers. Missing a few participation points due to these reasons should not affect your final grade if you score enough points from other activities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>What if I sent the SMS answer but I did not get participation points?</b><br>
            Please inform our tutor in charge during the following lecture. Remember to bring your phone to show the sent message.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>How does the system know which number belongs to which student?</b><br>
            It picks up the HP number from myISIS. Please update your HP number using myISIS.
        </li>

<p>
    <b>Webcast</b>: All lectures will be webcast. However, some things are not captured well in the webcast recording. Please treat the webcast as a 'backup' for you to catch up anything missed during the lecture.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Handouts</b>: Each lecture consists of 1-3 sections, supported by separate handouts. These handouts will be uploaded to the module website (see the 'Schedule' page) by Wednesday midnight of the same week. You are welcome to, but not required to, read through them before attending the lecture.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="highlighted">Read before tutorials</span>: You are required to read the relevant handouts and ponder how to apply those concepts in your project before attending the corresponding tutorial. If you have any followup questions about handouts, please ask during tutorials (if there is spare time) or post in IVLE forums.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Post-lecture quizzes</b>: Each lecture will be followed by a quiz, which has two parts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="important">[Compulsory: worth participation points]</span> An IVLE quiz for you to self-test how well you understood the handouts and other “required” readings (if any). You can keep taking the quiz until you get full marks. We count the best effort only. Points will be added to the leaderboard in the following week.<br>
        IVLE quizzes open on Friday 5pm and closes on Tuesday 2359.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strike>Some essay questions hosted on TEAMMATES: These are for you to reflect on the lecture/handout content and extract out what you think are the important points. It will help you practice 'generalization' skills (an important part of 'learning to learn'). Bonus points for these answers will be given later in the semester. Answering at least some of these questions can be beneficial when you apply for CS2103 tutorships and when you ask for reference letters from Damith/Henry.</strike> <span class="important">{Removed to reduce workload}</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strike>Note that we have to break the quiz into two parts because the way they are taken, graded, shared, and archived are different. The first part fits IVLE while the second part fits TEAMMATES.</strike>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Slides</b>: Since we are giving separate handouts, lecture slides do not contain content that you can print and use as a reference for exams. Instead, handouts serve as the main exam reference while slides will play only a supporting role during lecture delivery. <span class="highlighted">Slides will be uploaded</span> <i>after</i> the lecture.
