<h3>V0.1 Product</h3>
<div id="handbook-project-v01-product"></div>
<p>
  This is the starter project refactored to be more like your target product. Functionality can be limited to only those
  that can be refactored from the starter project.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>submission</strong>: Upload the code to GitHub.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>deadline</strong>: *Before* your tutorial slot. No last-minute hacking during the tutorial.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>grading</strong>: The most important thing is to have a working version of the system.<br>
  15 points (if you have passed the minimal level of progress expected at this time). Less than 15 if you need
  some catching up to do, depending on how far behind you are.
</p>

<h3>V0.1 Documentation</h3>
<div id="handbook-project-v01-documentation"></div>
<p>
  Your project documentation should contain following sections:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong> Team page</strong>: As before. Use the same template. Change '[V0.0]' to '[V0.1]' in the page
    header.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong> Credits</strong>: Acknowledgements of any third party materials used (if any). You may also
    list any extra (i.e. not required by the module) tool/technique you used (we want to know who went beyond
    the given set of tools/techniques). Omit this section if you did not use any third party materials.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> User guide</strong>: As before. You may modify this section if you’ve changed the features since
    the last submission. It is ok if some of the features mentioned here are not implemented yet.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Developer guide</strong>: The intended audience for this document is an incoming developer (i.e. a new
    project
    member) that will depend on this document to tell how the product has been designed and implemented.That
    is, it will be used for onboarding new developers. The document contains just enough information required
    for that person to get into the project. The basic questions you should ask yourself when writing this
    document are:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      What do we know about the system at this point?
    </li>
    <li>
      Which part of that knowledge will be useful for a new project member?
    </li>
    <li>
      What is the best way to pass that knowledge to the new member? Note that some information can be passed on in
      the form of code without any additional documentation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Given below are some things you could consider including. Note that you are not required to include them
    all. Neither you are restricted to what is listed below.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Architecture
    </li>
    <li>
      important APIs of each component
    </li>
    <li>
      Design descriptions (can include class diagrams, sequence diagrams, notable algorithms ...)
    </li>
    <li>
      Code examples (only if necessary to explain an intricate implementation detail)
    </li>
    <li>
      Instructions for setting up and testing
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Suggested max length for this section: 10 pages excluding cover page and appendices.
  </p>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>submission</strong>: <span class="highlighted">Submit a single pdf file</span> that
  contain all sections described above. File
  name is as before, but change ‘V0.0’ to ‘V0.1’. Submit to the appropriate IVLE folder.
  You may use GitHub to
  create an online user guide and a developer guide (see the <a href="https://github.com/collate/collate">
  collate project</a> for an example), but you should
  still submit the project manual as a pdf file.
